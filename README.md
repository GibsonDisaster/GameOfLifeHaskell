# GameOfLifeHaskell
Conways Game of Life written in Haskell using the ANSI Terminal package

Once you have the ANSI Terminal package installed through cabal, just run the command "ghc -o GameOfLife Main.hs" and then run "./GameOfLife" to play simulation.

Soon I will let the user input their own grid when they start the program, to allow different simulations.
