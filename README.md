# GameOfLifeHaskell
Conways Game of Life written in Haskell using the ANSI Terminal package

Once you have the ANSI Terminal package installed through cabal, just run the command "ghc -o GameOfLife Main.hs" and then run "./GameOfLife file_with_grid.txt" to play simulation.

You can give the program your own grid by following the layout and style of the example "grid.txt" and passing it as the first
argument of the program
